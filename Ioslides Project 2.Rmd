## Research Question

What factors contribute to employee attrition?

How likely is an employee to leave their company based on these factors? (Prediction effectiveness)

## Overview

- Logistic Regression Model
- Plots
- Model 1
- Model 2
- Summary of Findings

## Logistic Regression Model

- Why Logistic Regression?
- Assess likelihood of Attrition based on factors to be determined
- Attrition is changed to binary variable (1 yes, 0 no)
- Test/Train Set
- Assessed qualities of 2 developed prediction models

## Attrition Vs Independent Variables

## Model 1

- 11 ind variables used: BusinessTravel, DistanceFromHome, EnvironmentSatisfaction, JobInvolvement, JobSatisfaction, NumCompaniesWorked, OverTime, RelationshipSatisfaction, WorkLifeBalance, YearsSinceLastPromotion, YearsWithCurrManager
- Prediction Model
- Hit Rate = 0.9796
- AUC = 0.7825

## Prediction Model 1 ROC

## Model 2

- 7 ind variables used: BusinessTravel, EnvironmentSatisfaction, JobInvolvement, JobSatisfaction, OverTime, WorkLifeBalance, YearsWithCurrManager
- Prediction Model
- Hit Rate = 0.9762
- AUC = 0.7626

## Prediction Model 2 ROC

## Summary of Findings

- Model 1: # of variables used = 11, AIC = 875.35, AUC = 78.25%
- Model 2: # variables used = 7, AIC = 883.78, AUC = 76.26%
- Decrease in AUC and increase in AIC when moving from Model 1 to Model 2. Only slight changes
- Stick with Prediction Model 2 since the number of variables were decreased significantly
- Model 2 is more cost effective
- The HR department should pay extra attention to these 7 variables: (1)BusinessTravel (2)EnvironmentSatisfaction (3)JobInvolvement (4)JobSatisfaction (5)OverTime (6)WorkLifeBalance (7)YearsWithCurrManager in order to prevent the problem of attrition
